Belle Engine
This project is part of Belle. 
Belle is a cross-platform Visual Novel maker focused on being user friendly. It uses C++ with Qt4 for the editor and HTML5, CSS and Javascript for the engine.

-A game file that contains the description of the game. The game file must be named "game.json".

Running:
-If you have the game file and the needed media in this folder:
Just double-click the index.html, it should open with your default browser.

-If you have already a game file and media somewhere else:
You can just copy them to this folder and follow the step above.

-If you don't have the game the file:
You should use the Belle Editor, it will generate the game file automatically. 
You just need to create your game with it and then press the run button or use the option to export the project. It will ask you for the directory of this engine, if it can't find it.
